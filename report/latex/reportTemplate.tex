\section{Introduction and Motivations}

Vaccines are without doubt one of the greatest advances in medicine, whose widespread use has lead to the eradication or restriction of some of the deadliest diseases, including smallpox, polio and measles. Every vaccination carries a small risk of side effects. According to the WHO, severe adverse events are extremely rare for most vaccines (for the Hepatitis B vaccine only one in a million is affected) or not yet clinically proven like in the case of Hepatitis A.\footnote{WHO (2018-10-06)}  However, contested medical papers and rumours have led to a reluctance to vaccinate in parts of the society.
