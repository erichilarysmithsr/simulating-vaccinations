\section{Abstract}



\section{Individual contributions}

\section{Introduction and Motivations}

Vaccines are without doubt one of the greatest advances in medicine, whose widespread use has lead to the eradication or restriction of some of the deadliest diseases, including smallpox, polio and measles. Every vaccination carries a small risk of side effects. According to the WHO, severe adverse events are extremely rare for most vaccines (for the Hepatitis B vaccine only one in a million is affected) or not yet clinically proven like in the case of Hepatitis A.\footnote{WHO (2018-10-06), $http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/tools/vaccinfosheets/en/$}  However, contested medical papers and rumours have led to a reluctance to vaccinate in parts of the society.

\vspace{14px}

We modelled the specific case of Pertussis or Whooping cough, as there have been several incidents where a rising number of infections have been observed despite relatively high vaccination rates. One of these cases is the Netherlands, where, despite a coverage rate of 95\% several cases of Pertussis have been registered. One of the reasons is waning immunisation and the lack of people getting vaccinated. Even though these cases might be few, the survival of the disease means that the coverage rate should remain high. 

This paper tries to answer the question of how people take decisions on whenther to get vaccinated or not, and how the dynamics of the disease changes.

\section{Description of the Model}

\subsection{SIR Model}

We used an SIR model for the simulation of the spreading of Pertussis. Pertussis is transmitted by respiratory droplets human-to-human with an incubation period ranging from 9 to 14 days, while symptoms can last up to 6 weeks. \footnote{Torres Codeço, C; Mendes Luz, P; Is pertussis actually reemerging? Insights from an individual-based model, Cad. Saúde Pública vol.17 no.3 Rio de Janeiro May/June 2001}

\begin{lstlisting}
prob_for_diseases = 0.001 
#probability of infection from outside sources
prob_for_contact_infection = 0.5
\end{lstlisting}


This estimation is taken from a simulation which assesses the susceptibility of family members. We assume that a person has frequent contact with close family members and modulate the outcome with another variable that uses the probability that you meet with someone from your network on a given day to depict a realistic depiction of the society. 
\footnote{Estimation of Household Transmission Rates of Pertussis and the Effect of Cocooning Vaccination Strategies on Infant Pertussis Epidemiology23(6):852-860, November 2012}


\subsubsection{Modelling immunisation}
We assume that the vaccination provides 100\% safety, equal to having recovered from the disease. However, as recent research has shown that the protection considerably decreases about 10  years after the initial protection. 
To simplify the length of the protection acquired either by being vaccinated or by having recovered from Pertussis, we take a period of 13 years with a standard deviation of 2 years, which is on the conservative side, given that only 10\% of those vaccinated are still protected 12 years after the vaccination. There is less data available to assess the immunity after having recovered from the disease, but it can be assumed to be similar to the immunity acquired by vaccination. In addition we analyse a society with a high rate of coverage, so that the majority will have acquired their immunity by vaccination. 
As this dynamics of waning immunity already provides us with a constant population, we do not model births and deaths, as Pertussis is not a disease that frequenly causes death.

\subsection{Vaccination Decision}

We assume that every person is a rational decision maker, who decides whether or not to get vaccinated based on the perceived costs of getting vaccination vs risking getting sick.  \footnote{INSERT RESEACH ABOUT 12 YEARS HERE}  

has an initial inclination to vaccinate themselves, which we initialise before the simulation. 


\textbf{Cost functions}
To evaluate the probability of a person to get vaccinated, we use a static model in which each individual assesses their personal cost of getting vaccinated versus getting infected. 


\subsubsection{Perceived vaccination cost} 


\subsubsection{Perceived infection cost}
The perceived vaccination cost of a person changes in two scenarios:

1. When someone in the immediate surroundings is infected, the perceived infection cost rises by a factor of 1.2 (after recovery of the contact it decreases by 0.9).

2. When the global level of

\subsection{Important Parameters}
First we look at the dynamics of the disease. Pertussis is highly contagious, and is transmitted via the respiratory organs. Sneezing, coughing or even speaking can release enough infected particles to cause the disease, making crowded spaces such as public transport and educational institutions ideal for transmission. We therefore initialised everyone in the network to have 40 connections, of which he or she meets 40\% every day, which seems realistic given that even a short encounter on a train station might cause the disease. 
\begin{lstlisting}
#Random probability (per day and person) to become sick 
#without being infected by someone else
prob_for_diseases = 0.00003 

#probability to infect someone when there is contact
prob_for_contact_infection = 0.5 

#incubation time (in days)
incubation_time = 10
 
#days from infection, after this time a person is recovered
time_to_get_healthy = 10 
\end{lstlisting}

The patient starts being infectious 7 days after infection, and remains so until they recover \footnote{Bundeszentrale für Gesundheitliche Aufklärung Germany, Keuchhusten \break

\section{Implementation}
The model was implemented using Python. First, we wrote the basic SIR model with infection and recovery. Then we added the "vaccination function" which returns whether a person is getting vaccinated or not. Finally,
