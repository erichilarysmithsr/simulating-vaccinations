# simulating-vaccinations

* Group Name: simulating-vaccinations
* Group participants names: Hannah Niese, Markus Niese, Timo SchÃ¶negg
* Project Title: Simulating the impact of vaccination rates on disease spreading scenarios
* Programming language: Python 

## General Introduction

Vaccinations may be described as the most significant achievement in the history of medicine, and have lead to the eradication of many of the most severe diseases that plagued (and frequently decimated) societies. 
However, in developed countries, vaccination opponents have convinced a number of people not to get vaccinations, which could potentially lead to a revival of diseases we already thought extinct. Therefore, modelling the influence of vaccination rates on disease spreading is a worthwile pursuit.

## The Model

In our project we intend to simulate the behaviour of individuals using game theory and a SIR to model the trend of a disease. Every agent in our model tries to maximize their personal gain which is dependent on the perceived risk of side effects due to vaccination and the probability of infection, which itself is dependent on the number of vaccinated people. That means that the behaviour of one individual is affected by the behaviour of everyone else. To model that we will use the Nash-Equilibrium. The SIR, which is widely used in modelling the spread of diseases, will provide the parameters, several datasets on vaccination rates and effects of vaccination scares (UK 1970 polio, MMR starting 1998) will be used to test the model. 

> (Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abstraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

How do vaccination rates influence the spreading of diseases?
What are the critical vaccination rates of a society?
How would policy measures (vaccinating all school children etc.) change the spreading of diseases?

> (At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
> (Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )

## Expected Results

Using our model, we will simulate different scenarios to find out under which circumstances a disease can be eradicated und under which a decrease in the vaccination rate can lead to an uptake in infections.
Comparing the effectivity of policy measures with regards to immunisation.

# Reproducibility

Reproduce the graph of people who were at least once infected during simulation
time, dependent on the proportion of initially infected people in the population.
People do not vaccinate themselves during simulation.

To use the LIGHT version, the following steps have to be taken:

1. 
Download the files 
    LIGHT_network_0_to_100_percent.py
    vacc.py
    simulation_vaccination_tools.py
    network_generator.py
    
    folder networks with file 'barabasi_5000_2.txt' (This is a network with 5000 people)


2. 
Make sure you have matplotlib, numpy, csv, random, timeit and networkx installed.

3. 
Open your favourite python development environment e.g. Spyder, PyCharm etc.
Open the downloaded file LIGHT_network_0_to_100_percent.py 
Important: Do NOT change anything in this file.
Start the program.
It will iterate the percentage of vaccinated people from 0% to 100% with steps of 3%.
This might take 2-3 minutes, depending on the CPU of your computer. 
When it finished, it will output the graph of people who were at least once infected 
during the simulation time of 500 days. The graph might be in the background.

The following parameters can be changed:
- population (line 26): 
      You need to create a new network graph for the new population!
      Remove therefore the comment in line 28 to use the function
      network_generator.create_barabasi_in_file(population, 2, 'barabasi_' + str(population) + '_2.txt')
      Make sure there are enought initially infected people (at least ~3)
      by changing the initially_infected_people variable (line 105).
              
- simulation_length (line 51):
      Change the time periode (in days) of the simulation.
      Be careful: if the periode is to short, some people are still sick and
      can infect other people, when the simulation ends.
      
- stepwidth of iteration  (line 40):
      Decrease the stepwith of the iteration throught the percentage of initially
      vaccinated people for more exact results.
      stepwidth needs to be an integer!
