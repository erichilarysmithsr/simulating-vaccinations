## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

Vaccinations may be described as the most significant achievement in the history of medicine, and have lead to the eradication of many of the most severe diseases that plagued (and frequently decimated) societies. 


## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abstraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )
How do vaccination rates influence the spreading of diseases?
What are the critical vaccination rates of a society?
How would policy measures (vaccinating all school children etc.) change the spreading of diseases?

## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)
Creating models that simulate the infection rates of a society with different vaccination rates. 
Compare the effectivity of policy measures with regards to immunisation. 

## References

## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

(mention datasets you are going to use)

# Reproducibility

(step by step instructions to reproduce your results. *Keep in mind that people reading this should accomplish to reproduce your work within 10 minutes. It needs to be self-contained and easy to use*. e.g. git clone URL_PROY; cd URL_PROY; python3 main.py --light_test (#--light test runs in less than 5minutes with up to date hardware))
