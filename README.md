* Group Name: simulating-vaccinations
* Group participants names: Hannah Niese, Markus Niese, Timo Sch√∂negg
* Project Title: Simulating the impact of vaccination rates on disease spreading scenarios
* Programming language: Python 

## General Introduction

Vaccinations may be described as the most significant achievement in the history of medicine, and have lead to the eradication of many of the most severe diseases that plagued (and frequently decimated) societies. 
However, in developed countries, vaccination opponents have convinced a number of people not to get vaccinations, which could potentially lead to a revival of diseases we already thought extinct. Therefore, modelling the influence of vaccination rates on disease spreading is a worthwile pursuit. 


## The Model

In our project we intend to simulate the behaviour of individuals using game theory and a SIR to model the trend of a disease. Every agent in our model tries to maximize their personal gain which is dependent on the perceived risk of side effects due to vaccination and the probability of infection, which itself is dependent on the number of vaccinated people. That means that the behaviour of one individual is affected by the behaviour of everyone else. To model that we will use the Nash-Equilibrium. The SIR, which is widely used in modelling the spread of diseases, will provide the parameters, several datasets on vaccination rates and effects of vaccination scares (UK 1970 polio, MMR starting 1998) will be used to test the model. 


## Fundamental Questions

How do vaccination rates influence the spreading of diseases?
What are the critical vaccination rates of a society?
How would policy measures (vaccinating all school children etc.) change the spreading of diseases?


## Expected Results

Using our model, we will simulate different scenarios to find out under which circumstances a disease can be eradicated und under which a decrease in the vaccination rate can lead to an uptake in infections.
Comparing the effectivity of policy measures with regards to immunisation.

# Reproducibility

For detailed description of the full test please read code/readme.txt

LIGHT TEST: (20 minutes, one graph)
Reproduce the graph showing the number of people who get the disease in
dependence of how many people are vaccinated in the beginning (in percent).
People do not vaccinate themselves during simulation.

Follow these steps

1. Download the files:
    LIGHT_network_0_to_100_percent.py,
    vacc.py,
    simulation_vaccination_tools.py,
    network_generator.py,
    folder networks with file 'barabasi_5000_2.txt'
    (This is a network with 5000 people)


2. Make sure you have matplotlib, numpy and random installed.

3. Open your favourite python development environment e.g. Spyder, PyCharm etc.
   Open the downloaded file LIGHT_network_0_to_100_percent.py 
   Important: Do NOT change anything in this file. All parameters are set
   to appropriate values.
   Start the program.
   It will iterate the percentage of vaccinated people from 0% to 100% with steps
   of 3%. This might take 2-3 minutes, depending on the CPU of your computer.
   When finished, it will output the graph of people who were at least once
   infected during the simulation time of 500 days. The graph might be in the
   background.
   Note that your graph is not as smooth as the corresponding graph in the report,
   as that one is a average of multible simulations.

If you now want to play around a little bit, you can change the
following parameters:
Note that extreme values of the parameters may lead to extreme results.

- population (line 76):
      In the folder networks we provide several networks for different
      population sizes. You can change the population variable in one 
      of these populations.
      Make sure there are enought initially infected people (at least ~3)
      by changing the initially_infected_people variable (line 130).
              
- simulation_length (line 73):
      Change the time periode (in days) of the simulation.
      Be careful: if the periode is to short, some people are still sick and
      can infect other people, when the simulation ends.
      
- stepwidth of iteration  (line 66):
      Decrease the stepwith of the iteration throught the percentage of
      initially vaccinated people for more exact results.
      stepwidth needs to be an integer!
